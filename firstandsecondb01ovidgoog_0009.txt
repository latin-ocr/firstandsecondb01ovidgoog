PREFACE.

-0004-

Tffls book conlorms to the general plan ol the series
of School Classics. A limited portion of the Metamor-
phoses has been selected, ¹with the expectation that other
volumes will follow, thus enabling the teacher at different
times to read from various parts ol the poem. Some
omissions have been made in the first and second books
of passages not adapted for reading in the secondary
schools, but not in sufficient amount to render obscure
the continuity ol the work. This important matter is
also helped by a brief summary in English of the omitted
passages.

While certain schools with along course in Latin read
from twenty-five hundred to three thousand lines of Ovid,
there are many others that can read but fifteen hundred
lines.. Some model programs and reports call for the
latter number. This book, therefore, has been made to
contain fifteen hundred lines by the addition of Ovid's
Autobiography‚ which not only serves as a basis for the
study of Ovid's life, but also introduces the student to

the elegiae pentameter.
